Project:

Create a register application with an OOP database, with functionalities for
update,delete,insert and select(CRUD), and with interfaces.

1- for the interfaces, I'll use the SceneBuilder and JavaFX.

2- for the OOP database I'll use the "DB4o" lib.

===========Sketch===========

*Menu page with the operations needed (INSERT, DELETE, SELECT, UPDATE)

*1 page intended for each operation.

*1 class intended for client information

*MVC architecture

-Model class will contain the algorithm for each operation of the referent page. (business rule)

-View class will be the view pages that capture the information from the user.

-Controller class will process the information received by the view class.

*Design pattern: singleton for using the same instance of the database.

*Styling: as simple as possible 

*This project won't have authentication for the login since is a basic application 

*it also won't have treatment for the information received, the goal is just to make the functionalities
and save it on this database
